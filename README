VIVO Org Chart Creator

These are small scripts to extract the org chart structure from vivo.

INSTALLATION

example.rb requires the RDF::Raptor gem to work.

Install the gem with:

sudo gem install rdf rdf-raptor.

The RDF::Raptor gem requires the Raptor RDF Parser to install. 

On centos: sudo yum install raptor
On ubuntu: sudo apt-get install raptor-utils

graph_image_creator.rb requires both RDF::Raptor and Graphviz gem to work.

To install the graphviz gem:

sudo gem install graphviz


example.rb

If you are new to working with vivo and rdf please look at this script first. This a simplified version of graph_image_creator.rb that creates only text output of the organizational structure. 

This program starts from a seed uri (for example, http://vivo.ufl.edu/UniversityofFlorida) and recursively traverses all organizations it can find. 

Run the program by typing:

ruby example.rb

graph_image_creator.rb

This program works in the same fashion as example.rb but uses the graphviz gem to build an svg file of the output.
